# Data_Engineering_Project

Goal: Build an end-to-end pipeline that extracts data from an API, processes it, and loads it into a database.
Key Topics:
API integration (e.g., REST ).
Data transformation using Python (e.g., polars).
Loading data into a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Automating the pipeline with Apache Airflow.
Example: Build a real-time weather data ETL pipeline and load data into a database for downstream analysis.
